# Masked-LFW-Dataset-Mask-Parsing
This repository contains code for applying our face parsing technology to the Masked LFW Dataset. Our algorithm accurately identifies masked regions and sets their pixel values to 0, effectively segmenting the face from the mask. It is an essential step towards advanced facial recognition tasks in masked images.
